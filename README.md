# API Tests Demo Project

This project demonstrates how to write API tests using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/). It provides examples of how to interact with an API and perform various test scenarios.

## Prerequisites

Before running the tests, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version X.X.X)
- Playwright (version X.X.X)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Configure the API endpoint:

    Open the `config.js` file and update the `API_ENDPOINT` variable with the URL of your API.

4. Run the tests:

    ```bash
    npm test
    ```

## Test Scenarios

This project covers the following test scenarios:

- [Scenario 1: Testing API endpoint X](./tests/scenario1.js)
- [Scenario 2: Testing API endpoint Y](./tests/scenario2.js)
- [Scenario 3: Testing API endpoint Z](./tests/scenario3.js)

Feel free to explore the test files to see how the API requests are made and assertions are performed.
